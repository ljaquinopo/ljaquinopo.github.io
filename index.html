			<p>What a wonderful day! My name is Lyka Joyce M. Aquino, and you can just call me LJ. ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ♡  My favorite subject is CMSC 22 because I enjoyed the concepts of object-oriented programming, and it also kind of challenged me, that's why I did extra efforts for it which made it unforgettable. On the other side, my favorite GE is KAS 1, because my professor explained the history very entertaining and detailed that made me understand many reasons why people behave the way they do. When it comes to programming languages, my favorite is still Python, because for me it is still the easiest and I am knowledgeable in this language the most. Lastly, my favorite food is Kare-kare and Sinigang na baboy!!! No explanation needed.</p>
			<p>My hobbies are watching thriller movies and dancing!! Sometimes, I also do singing, in my dreams. Ohh, I also cook, by the way. My childhood dream is to have a house that has a pool, but now I just want a small and comfortable house where I can always feel safe and at peace.</p>
